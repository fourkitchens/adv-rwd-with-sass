<h1>Fact</h1>

<p>Design starts at the <strong>content</strong>, not the page</p>

<p class="fragment">Pictures fail to provide any context and cannot adapt the the large (and growing) number of variables that must be designed for</p>

<p class="fragment">The "page" is (mostly) irrelevant; it's ever changing. Tying your design to the idea of a page will harm your user experience</p>

* Each model is an overview of a type of content available
* Models must contain at least one [user persona's](http://pointnorth.io/#user-personas) [benefit statement](http://pointnorth.io/#benefit-statement) with [value](http://pointnorth.io/#size-and-value)
* Good models include both visible and structural attributes (chunks that make up a piece of content)
* Attributes should be determined by [content inventory](http://pointnorth.io/#content-inventory) and [content audit](http://pointnorth.io/#content-audit)
* Should be presentation independent
